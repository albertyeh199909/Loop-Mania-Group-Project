**Combat:**
- Attack order is determined by an attack speed attribute. If two values are equal, randomise attack order.

**Enemies:**
- Some users want to see the battle and support radius, more experienced users may not.
- Maximum of 1 enemy per tile.
- Allied soldier turned zombies are able to infect other soldiers too (through critical bite).

**Equipment:**
- Equipment is vague in its description. Assumption is that (e.g. for armour), "provides defence" equals "halves enemy attack" and isn't an extra property.

**Inventory:**
- Health potion is added to inventory for later consumption instead of automatically being consumed.
